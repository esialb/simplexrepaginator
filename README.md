Ingests PDF files of double-sided (duplex) documents scanned with
a single-sided (simplex) scanner.  Output is a corresponding PDF
that has been "repaginated" so that the front and back pages of each
paper sheet are in the correct order.

Scanning a stack of paper sheets, first face-up and then face-down,
results in a logical page ordering such as this: 1,3,5,7,8,6,4,2.
This project will ingest that PDF file and produce one whose pages
are in the logical order 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Primary purpose is enable allow batch scanning of household files
using inexpensive simplex document-feeder scanners.
